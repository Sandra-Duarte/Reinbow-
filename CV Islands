  Cabo Verde consists of nine inhabited islands, one uninhabited island,  
  and various islets, located between 14°30′ and 17°30′ N and between 22°30′ and 25°30′ W. 
  The archipelago is divided into the Barlavento (Windward) group to the north and the Sotavento (Leeward) group to the south.
  The Barlavento Islands include Santo Antão, São Vicente, Santa Luzia (which is uninhabited), São Nicolau, Sal, and Boa Vista, 
   together with the islets of Raso and Branco. The Sotavento Islands include Maio, Santiago, Fogo, and Brava and the three islets called the Rombos—Grande,
